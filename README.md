1340 group project
Employers have to manage their own employees. Without a computer program to handle it, it is quite troublesome.
An employee management system uses a series of methods to gather and manage information about the employees of a business. 
It will be more efficient.
In this case,we would like to develop a system to collect and manage the employee information of a company.

The program system will include the following item:
 1) create a new employee with employee ID, name, age, role, and salary;
 2) search for and delete an employee via their ID, name, age or role;
 3) fire an employee;
 4) edit the details of an existing employee;
 5) search for all employees with a salary higher than or lower than a user input;
 6) allow adding user-defined attributes,s, the value of a new attribute of the existing employee should be empty or undefined;
 7) company can use a equation to quantify the Productivity or Contribution level by using those employees data such as age, Contributing times history.
